* Q9 - I chose the incorrect option because I misread the question answers. The new system actually makes it impossible to make the incorrect department selection. The correct answer B is more reasonable because the voice/answer is automated. There will not be a human representative ready to receive the call.
* Q11 - The new process makes it easier to determine whether an issue requires a human or a recording. The question is asking what will help direct calls, which the list of computers that the company owns and the IP address does not matter as well.
* Q28 - Data compression has more uses than just being transmitted over the Internet. It can be used to make more space in storage, and other uses. There are trade offs in different forms of data compression because different types do different things. For example, Lossy and Lossless compression do different things and are different techniques for storing data. Some compress more data, but make it hard to recover the data at the same time.
* Q37 - There are 2 If statements and only one else statement. So, it runs both if statements separately. When x is the max it runs the first if statement, but then goes on and runs the else statement. This displays both x and z.
* Q40 - Requiring every school to meet a requirement will ensure that all students get a certain level of computing. This helps, as everyone will have a similar level of technology. Not everyone will have access to the city Web site, so putting all the documents there would not help the digital divide.
* Q50 - The original process is lossy because there is only a small loss of image quality. Even this small loss makes it lossy. Creating a new RGB Triplet make it lossless because the original has the ability to be restored.

* Q12 - Getting descriptions and photographs of local landmarks would benefit the most from crowdsourcing. The option I picked would not benefit from having multiple users do it, and it would be each user compressing their own data. Getting photos and descriptions from others is the best way, which is done through crowdsourcing. 
* Q21 - Storing all the data in a database would not change the data storage needed. Instead, it will increase it as all the data remains in the code. Instead, using a database will allow for machine learning which can then be used to make improvements to the application based on the user behavior that is gathered. 
* Q22 - I was unfamiliar with the differences between IPv6 and IPv4. IP addresses are hierarchial no matter what. IPv6 does allow for more devices thatn 4, because it has a greater number of IP addresses
* Q24 - Redundancy allows for multiple paths, however the same amount of packets are required. If some paths fail, there are still paths for packets to be sent on, which is the benefit as there could be another route for data to be sent.
* Q30 - The first value must be 75, which is represented in binary by 01001011, and the third must be 130 which is represented through binary as 010000010, as it is 2^7 + 2^1.
* Q35 - Integers are not subject to rounding areas. An overflow error can occur when an arithmetic operation results in a value that is not within the the range of numbers that can be represented through the bits.
* Q43 - The code segment I chose will put the robot in the bottom right corner, which is not what the original robot goes. Instead, using part A utilizes the segment by adding 1 to count each time in order to end at the same spot as the original code.
