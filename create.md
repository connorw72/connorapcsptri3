# Create Task

# Main Idea
For the create task, I plan to build off of last tri's jeopardy game that I coded. I plan to make some adjustments, but as of now I plan to go off this plan and the code that was created. With the Jeopardy game I coded, it met all of the Create Task requirements that were previously needed. I will add and improve this project, but I believe this will be my base.

# How Requirements Are Met
1. List - there is a list of variables which represent the questions.

2. There is a procedure to determine the score and if the question was answered correctly. It checks the value of the input, then goes through the procedure to see if it adds to the score or subtracts from it.

3. The algorithm includes sequencing because you go through if then statements to see if the answer is correct. There is selection as the score is only added to if a certain answer is inputted. In addition, there is iteration through the array of questions in order to display the questions.

4. The student developed procedure is called to upon pressing the submit answer button.

5. There is input as the user types in the answer that they believe to be true.

6. The output comes in the form of the score, as based on the user input this output will be produced.
